# üé≠ pw-educamos-notifier üé≠

pw-educamos-notifier is a server-based application that connects to CLM "Educamos" platform, retrieves all the unread messages and sends them to a given Telegram chat.

## Description

_CLM Educamos_ is a communication platform for schools in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). One of its purposes is sending and receiving messages from/to the teachers of your children. 

An email is received each time a message is sent to the platform, but only the subject of the message is included, forcing you to access the platform in order to read the content of those notifications, as well as getting the attachments, if any.

This program makes use of üé≠ Playwright üé≠ to simulate user interaction with Educamos, retrieves all the unread messages, downloads the attachments and sends them to a given Telegram chat. You can fork and/or adapt the bot in order to send notifications to other services, if needed.

## Disclaimer

There is no warranty for this software, so use it at your own risk. Remember that once a message has been opened, it will be removed from the inbox default view, so any issue related to the notification can lead in missing important information related to the Educamos platform if you're not paying enough attention.

## Project background

I've some years of experience automating E2E tests with Selenium and Cypress, and I was curious about Playwright. Given that Educamos platform lacks of a good notification service, I decided to learn it playing around with it while solving that problem.

The Playwright module provides an implementation of the POM model, using a the `PageObject` class as base class. Feel free to use it and improve it if you like it. Remember that I'm a newcomer in this technology in the time I coded this and any suggestion will be welcome. Besides that, there're two scripts that make easier the Page Object generation: `po-codegen-inline.ts` and `po-codegen.ts`. Providing a class name and a map with the desired locators with a given friendly name will generate the scaffolding of any Page Object for your Playwright project. However, remember that this has been done while learning the framework, so please forgive me for any mistakes I may have made.

## Dependencies
- Node v20.17.0
- Playwright v1.47.1
- axios 1.7.7
- dotenv 16.4.5
- node-cron 3.0.3
- typescript 5.6.2
- ts-node 10.9.2

## Installation
To install all necessary dependencies run the command:
```
npm run setup
```
Then, create an `.env` file with the following environment variables:
```
EDUCAMOS_USERNAME=""
EDUCAMOS_PASSWORD=""
EDUCAMOS_LOGIN_URL="https://educamosclm.castillalamancha.es/accesoeducamos/"
DOWNLOADS_FOLDER="downloads"
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=""
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=""
CRON_SCHEDULE="*/30 * * * *"
```

You must provide your Educamos credentials, as well as the token of your own telegram bot and the chat id where the messages should be sent.

If you don't know how to create a Telegram bot and generate that information, check [this link](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot). I assure you it's quite simple (and also for free).

If you're running the application with its service version, you should also provide a cron configuration. If you don't know how to do so, check some examples [here](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html#EXAMPLE_CRON_FILE).

## Execution

### Single execution
You can run the notifier just once:

```
npm run once
```

Add a manual cron job to your system in case you want it to be scheduled in your system in a regular basis. A Raspberry Pi is useful for that :smile:

### Built-in service via node-cron
You can also run it as a service, polling the Educamos platform based on the cron configuration stored in the `CRON_SCHEDULE` environment variable.
```
npm run start-service
```

### Run as a service using pm2 (recommended)
Another way to schedule a polling for the application is using pm2. To do so, install it in your system:
```
npm install pm2 -g
```

It's advisable to configure logging to avoid logs to fill your disk space:
```
pm2 install pm2-logrotate
pm2 set pm2-logrotate:compress true
pm2 set pm2-logrotate:retain 2
```

By default, the script `once` triggers a single polling operation.
```
   "scripts": {
     ...
     "once": "NODE_PATH=./src ts-node app.ts",
     ...
   }
```

However, pm2 is configured by default to re-trigger every 30 minutes. You can change this value changing the parameter `cron_restart` in the file `ecosystem.config.js`:
```
{
  ...
  cron_restart: "*/30 * * * *",
}
```

Then start the service and save it into pm2 configuration:
```
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --only pw-educamos-notifier
pm2 save
```

As a last step, you can configure pm2 to be triggered on system start
```
pm2 startup
```

To check pm2 logs and resource consumption, just type as follows:
```
pm2 logs my-app
pm2 logs monit
```
